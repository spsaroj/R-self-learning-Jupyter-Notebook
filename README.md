# R

This repo is my notebook made while learning R programming from [freecodecamps.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).
The original video can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V8eKsto3Ug). 

## Want to use this notebook?
Since freecodecamps.org is a free resource and this repo is just my interpretation of that tutorial, you are free to use this resource for your own.
